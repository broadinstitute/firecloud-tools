## Import a TSV that is too large to load directly into FireCloud
This script imports a TSV file when it is too large to import from the GUI.

Run this as follows (from the main directory):
```./run.sh import_large_tsv/import_large_tsv.py -p <workspace project> -n <workspace name> -f <tsv file name>```
